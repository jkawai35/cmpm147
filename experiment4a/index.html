				<h2>Description</h2>
				<p>I used the infinite extent of my game to represent an endlessly running river. The state of the water 
					is always changing. As the user moves through the world they will see various areas that have
					different water movements with random highlights as if the sun is shining upon the river.
					Different worlds will have different highlight patterns with slightly different water movements.
					When the use clicks on a tile, a small ripple will be made and will eventually fade away.
				</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Technical</h2>
				<p>This project uses procedural generation techniques to generate the everflowing river. It utilizes a hashing function
					to determine which tiles are highlighted.

				<h2>Reflection</h2>
				<p>This was one of three generators that I created, and after spending a lot of time on one of them
					the other two came rather easy. I was the only one working on this project and only received help
					from ChatGPT and not from other students in the class.
