				<h2>Description</h2>
				<p>This project brings life to a 2D picture of hot air balloons flying over mountains and hills.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Technical</h2>
				<p>Relation to inspring image:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Color: Used various shades of green for the mountain layers, simulated horizon with blue + warm colors, and used random colors for balloons.</li>
					<li>Primitives: Used ellipses and rectangles for the balloons.</li>
					<li>Polygons: The mountains are customized polygons and change depending on the position of your cursor.</li>
					<li>Generativity: Different random seed values lead to differently shaped mountains and differently colored balloons.</li>
					<li>Life: You can move your cursor to the right to see the rest of the balloon parade. Balloons that are closer to the cursor will be bigger and will get smaller as you move the cursor away. This can simulate zooming or how we would perceive closer up objects in real life.</li>
				</ul>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Reflection</h2>
				<p>This project was done without the help of other students, but did receive aid from ChatGPT to work out some of the details in the picture. I wanted to do my best to recreate
					the mountains and have the balloons appear as if they are following eachother, and I think that that was reasonably translated in this experiement. It wasn't the easiest thing to do
					but eventually, everything came together.
