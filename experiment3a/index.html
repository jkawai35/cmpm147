               <h2>Description</h2>
               <p>With this project, I was trying to create a dungeon generator that wouldcreate
                a top down layout of rooms and paths that would represent a typical 2D
                dungeon crawler game. The "." start for the outlines of the rooms and are 
                made with the brick-like tiles. The "P" stands for path which conencts each room.
                "C" stands for chest which can be found in each room. The animated shadow effect
                is meant to simulate a stormy type night with lightning and how lightning causes
                light to fade in and out of a scene.
               </p>
           </div>


           <div class="minor-section">
               <h2>Technical</h2>
               <p>This project uses noise to "randomly" place rooms using a function that 
                create rectangles. A simple pathfinding function is also used to make the path that 
                connect each room to eachother. A chest is then placed in every room. The shadow effect
                is uses rect() to create the shapes that fade in and out based on time using millis().
               </p>
           </div>


           <div class="minor-section">
               <h2>Reflection</h2>
               <p>I worked on this project without the help of any students in the class.
                ChatGPT was used to help with the animation and the pathfinding since I had a really hard time implementing those.
                Figuring out the autotiling system was mainly done on my own and being able to use noise() to 
                make each reseed more intersting was relatively easy to implement.
               </p>
           </div>
