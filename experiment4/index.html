				<h2>Description</h2>
				<p>I used the infinite extenet of my world to represent an endless dance floor with
					endless possibilites of expression. As the user moves though the world, they will see
					varying color changing areas with white patches scattered through out to represent spotlights.
					Different worlds will have different spotlight light arrangements and there will be variations
					with the rainbow lights as well. Clicking on a tile will disable it and fill it with a black color.
                    
                </p>

				<h2>Technical</h2>
				<p>This project uses prodedural generation techniques to create a constantly changing color landscape that has random patches of light.
				</p>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Reflection</h2>
				<p>This was one of three generators that I created, and after spending a lot of time on one of them
					the other two came rather easy. I was the only one working on this project and only received help
					from ChatGPT and not from other students in the class.
