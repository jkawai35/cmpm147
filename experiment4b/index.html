				<h2>Description</h2>
				<p>The infinite extent of the generator is meant to reflect the infinite possibilities available 
					when creating abstract art. It also is a visual potrayal of trial and error and trying new techniques and 
					ideas and developing ones what show signs of reasonable implementation. As the user moves throught the world
					they will see the geometrical abastract pattern with various tiles blinking a rainbow color. The screen will 
					also get brighter at times with the implemented breathing effect. If a user clicks on a tile, they will be able to 
					mark it with a blinking red color. This can be used to create patterns that are reset if the seed is changed. Changing the 
					seed will also rearrange the rainbow tiles.
				</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Technical</h2>
				<p>This project uses prodecural generation techniques to create the constantly changing abstract pattern that
					is shown. It uses a hasing function to determine which tiles will be blinking various colors and refers
					to frame count to determine the length of the breathing effect that changes brightness over time.
				</p>

				<h2>Reflection</h2>
				<p>This was one of three generators that I created, and after spending a lot of time on one of them
					the other two came rather easy. I was the only one working on this project and only received help
					from ChatGPT and not from other students in the class.</p>
