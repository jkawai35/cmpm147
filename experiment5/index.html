				<h2>Description</h2>
				<p>This generator crates geometrical representations of images using the p5.js library. This project
                    keeps track of the best image that is created and past iterations of the image based on what percentage
                    the slider is at.
                </p>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Technical</h2>
                    <p>This projcet uses pre selected inspiratoinal images to create parametric recreations of them.
                        There is a menu that allows the user to change which image is being created as there are different
                        behaviors associated with each image. The user can also change how rapidly the shapes are changing.
                    </p>

				<h2>Annealing</h2>
                <p>The most interesting results from this kind of evolutionary generator are often achieved by continually adjusting the mutation rate. Set the slider to 100%, reset the generator, and then slowly drag the slider down to 1% over the period of about 30 seconds. This allows the generator to make large design changes at the start while allowing it to focus on finely details towards the end. This is best done by hand while watching the outputs improve because you can use your human judgment to decide when the generator needs to be making bigger or smaller changes to keep making progress.
                </p>

				<h2>Reflection</h2>
				<p>I spent a lot of time working on creating the varying behviors, and it was difficult getting everything to draw on the canvas correctly. For future 
                    directons with this project I would like to implement color, but for this project iternation I wanted to focus on the technical aspects and making sure that
                    the recreations made by the genrator were similar to the original image.
                </p>
